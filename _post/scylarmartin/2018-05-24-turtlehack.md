Here's my logic turtle.
The basic idea of my logic turtle is to interact with user and generate different graph with stamps leaving on it. There are some 
additional features, such as background color I can add in the future, I should also add the feaure that multiple turtle chasing on 
each other once i figure that out.

Here comes my turtlehacks, the project is much more time-consuming than I thought. My original idea is to create a scenario that multiple 
turtles chasing each other, along with the change of turtlr color, moving direction, and background color. But I encounter some difficulty 
on set the speed within a fixed trail and cannot control all the turtle in the same time when they make a turn. Thus I change to project
to make five turtle in a running race.  I add the function feature that learned in the function chapter with the random module. The manual
is kind of hard to understand for me. I am enlighted by this link a lot.:+<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/9339862606" width
