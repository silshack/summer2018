For my Turtlehack, I decided to make a calendar of major holidays/dates that are important to me. You can see it here: <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/65b3facdd7" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
It was very simple, but it is something I would like to expand on and determine how to keep it constantly updted, without hardcoding updates myself.
